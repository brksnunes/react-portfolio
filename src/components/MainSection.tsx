        ABOUT ME
      </Heading>
      <Text mt='5'>
        Hello, i'm Rodrigo Nunes. I have a degree in System Analysis and
        Development at UMC (Universidade de Mogi das Cruzes) - 2017, currently a
        Web Development student at Trybe and a tech lover. I love everything
        tech, from hardware to software. On my spare time, i like experimenting
        with electronics, 3D printing random things and messing around with
        Linux. Also as a hobby, i like experimenting with Docker and
        Self-Hosting, mainly to understand and learn how Docker works and to
        have fun with it. I have experience with Linux systems, such as Ubuntu
        Server, Debian based distros, Fedora, CentOS and Arch, basic experience
        with wired and wireless networks, basic experience with Java and C# and
        MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. I look forward to build exciting
        projects, collaborate whenever i can, learn new stuff and have fun while
        doing it!
